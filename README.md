# Glassmorphism UI Demo

A minimal prototype that showcases the core principles of the glassmorphism trend—
soft, translucent surfaces layered over vibrant gradients with frosted-glass blur
and luminous lighting accents.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the directory with any static
file server to explore the design.

## Expansion ideas

Based on the current hero, cards, principles, and styleguide sections, the demo
could grow into a fuller UI kit by adding:

- A glassmorphism sidebar or dock with quick actions and profile status.
- Toast notifications and alert banners for layered overlays.
- A modal or command palette using the native `<dialog>` element.
- Frosted form controls (search, inputs, toggles, sliders) with focus states.
- Data widgets such as KPI tiles, charts, or activity timelines.
- A compact media player or calendar card to showcase dense layouts.
